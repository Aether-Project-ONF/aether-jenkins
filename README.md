# aether-jenkins
This repo defines Jenkins Pipelines for testing OnRamp Blueprints.
Each file (a Groovy script) defines an integration test for an
Aether OnRamp blueprint; they are executed daily at `jenkins.aetherproject.org`.
The blueprints are documented [here](https://docs.aetherproject.org/master/onramp/blueprints.html).
